# Build your own Java RAG AI Agent

 ☕️ Welcome to this workshop to build your own Java AI Agent using Retrieval Augmented Generation.

 🏆 It leverages the best of open-source for fast implementation of the RAG pattern for production quality applications.

 🤩 The completed RAG ChatBot will demonstrate how your AI Agent can do
 - LLM and Prompt Engineering
 - Conversational Memory
 - Vector Similarity Searching and Dense Passage Retrieval
 - Transform, chunk, and vectorise unstructured files like PDFs
 - Caching of LLM responses for latency and cost performance
 - Reranking of search results
 - Vector calculations using JVector
 - Online searching using the Tavily service
 - Hybrid Searching
 - Closed Loop Feedback System
 - LLM Function Calling
 - Time Series Vector Similarity Searching

 

 ♻️  This workshop uses Java 21, Spring AI and Vaadin for the UI.  The use of Spring and Vaadin is minimal, the code is intended to be re-used in other frameworks.

 👩‍ It is CQL compatbile with Apache Cassandra® 5.0 and AstraDB Vector.  Database schemas and data models are intentionally flexible so the concepts in the workshop can be retrofitted to your needs and your production.

 🙇‍ The workshop will use the services: OpenAI, Tavily, and AstraDB.  You will need accounts and api keys for each of these.

 🌴 Each step in the workshop is a separate branch in this repository, you will need to be familiar with git switching between branches.

 💪🏽 To move on to read the [requirements setup step](../workshop-intro-requirements), do the following:
```
git switch workshop-intro-requirements
```
